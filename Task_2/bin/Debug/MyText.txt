It was on account of the scar that I first noticed him,
for it ran, broad and red, in a great crescent from his
temple to his chin. It must have been due to a formidable
wound and I wondered whether this had been caused by a sabre
or by a fragment of shell. It was unexpected on that round,
fat, and good-humoured face. He had small and undistinguished
features, and his expression was artless. His face went
oddly with his corpulent body. He was a powerful man of
more than common height. I never saw him in anything but
a very shabby grey suit, a khaki shirt, and a battered sombrero.
He was far from clean. He used to come into the Palace Hotel
at Guatemala City every day at cocktail time and strolling
leisurely round the bar offer lottery tickets for sale. If this
was the way he made his living it must have been a poor one for
I never saw anyone buy, but now and then I saw him offered a drink.
He never refused it. He threaded his way among the tables with a sort
of rolling walk as though he were accustomed to traverse long
distances on foot, paused at each table, with a little smile
mentioned the numbers he had for sale, and then, when no notice
was taken of him, with the same smile passed on. I think he was
for the most part a trifle the worse for liquor.
